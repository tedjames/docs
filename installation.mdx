## Getting Started

BrowserTools gives AI code editors and agents the ability to monitor and interact with your web browser for highly effective debugging and a more seamless developer experience - all in a safe and secure manner.

With this MCP server tool, you can enable AI code editors and agents to have access to:

- Console logs and errors
- XHR network requests/responses
- Screenshot capabilities
- Currently selected DOM elements

That way, you can simply tell Cursor or any AI code editor with MCP integrations:

<Tip>"Can you check console and network logs to see what went wrong?"</Tip>

<Tip>"Something doesn't look right in the UI. Can you take a screenshot?"</Tip>

<Tip>"Can you edit the currently selected element to do x, y and z?"</Tip>

For now, you can [click here to download the extension](https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp/releases/download/v1.0.0/browsertools-mcp-chrome-extension.zip) or clone the repo below and find the extension within the chrome-extension directory:

    > **1a.** Optionally download from Github

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash https
    git clone https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp.git
    ```

    </Frame>

    > **3d.** Confirm that the MCP server has been connected. You should see all the tools listed and a green circle next to the tool name.

    Wait a few seconds or click on the refresh button a few times if it does not register. If it still won't register make sure you entered the right command.

    {" "}

4.  **Run the BrowserTools Server**: Aggregates logs from the chrome extension and sets up websockets for screenshot capture. Run this from your terminal within any directory:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Note**: The browser-tools-server runs on port 3025. Make sure to terminate
  any processes running on this port. In a future release, we will handle this
  gracefully.
</Info>

---

5.  **Open the Chrome Developer Console**: Right click on any web page and click
    'Inspect' to open the Chrome dev tools. Once open, logs will be accessible to the
    MCP client.

  <Frame>

  <img
     className="block"
     src="/images/dev-tools.png"
     alt="Dev Tools"
     style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
   />
 </Frame>

You can navigate to the BrowserTools panel to:

- Manually capture a screenshot
- Define a path to save screenshots to (defaults to: `Downloads/mcp-screenshots`)
- Wipe all saved logs
- Modify logging size limits / truncation

<Info>
  **Note**: Logs will be wiped from the server everytime you refresh the page.
  You can manually wipe the logs by clicking the 'Wipe Logs' button in the
  BrowserTools panel.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title='Error: Screenshot tool is failing'>

    Cursor and some other MCP clients may not always fetch the correct version of the MCP server. Make sure to use `npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@1.0.11` instead to explicitly use the latest working version.

  </Accordion>
<Accordion title='Issue: Cannot see my screenshots'>

    Screenshots will be default be saved to your downloads folders within a `/mcp-screenshots` directory.
    Make sure to check there for the screenshots. Otherwise, you can add a path to save screenshots to in the
    BrowserToolsMCP dev tools panel.


    We suggest creating a screenshots folder in your current project, right click on the folder and click on 'copy path'. Then paste that into the dev tools panel and press enter.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Issue: Not seeing any logs'>

Make sure to open the chrome dev tools console in the browser tab that you want to capture logs from.

  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title='Issue: Seeing too many logs'>

Close down any other tabs that have the chrome dev tools open. BrowserToolsMCP will capture logs across many tabs.

  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Issue: Logs keep disappearing!'>

Anytime you refresh the page or restart the node process running the browser-tool-mcp server, your logs will be wiped.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Contact [@tedx_ai](https://x.com/tedx_ai) or add an issue to the [Github repo](https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp).
